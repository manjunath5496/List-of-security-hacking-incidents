<h3><span id="1967" class="mw-headline">1967</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The first known incidence of network penetration hacking took place when members of a computer club at a suburban Chicago area high school were provided access to IBM's&nbsp;<a title="APL (programming language)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)">APL</a>&nbsp;network. In the Fall of 1967, IBM (through&nbsp;<a title="Science Research Associates" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Research_Associates">Science Research Associates</a>) approached&nbsp;<a title="Evanston Township High School" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanston_Township_High_School">Evanston Township High School</a>&nbsp;with the offer of four&nbsp;<a title="IBM 2741" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_2741">2741 Selectric teletypewriter</a>&nbsp;based terminals with dial-up modem connectivity to an experimental computer system which implemented an early version of the APL programming language. The APL network system was structured in Workspaces which were assigned to various clients using the system. Working independently, the students quickly learned the language and the system. They were free to explore the system, often using existing code available in public Workspaces as models for their own creations. Eventually, curiosity drove the students to explore the system's wider context. This first informal network penetration effort was later acknowledged as helping harden the security of one of the first publicly accessible networks:

<p>Science Research Associates undertook to write a full APL system for the&nbsp;<a title="IBM 1500" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1500">IBM 1500</a>. They modeled their system after&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="APL\360" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL%5C360">APL/360</a>, which had by that time been developed and seen substantial use inside of IBM, using code borrowed from MAT/1500 where possible. In their documentation they acknowledge their gratitude to "a number of high school students for their compulsion to bomb the system". This was an early example of a kind of sportive, but very effective, debugging that was often repeated in the evolution of APL systems.</p>
